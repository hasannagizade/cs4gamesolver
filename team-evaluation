CS4 Project Team Evaluation

For each team member, including yourself, evaluate him or her based
on the following items.  Check one box for each question.  Be honest
in your assessment of each team member.  Your instructor will use this
to help determine the individual grade for each person.
The freeform comments evaluating yourself and your teammate are most important.

Additional comments:

First off, I'll admit this is far from the best code I've ever written.
In fact, there are many places where I'd like to have made it cleaner, more elegant, (inclusive) or more efficient.
This is a known problem and was a known problem as I was writing the project.
Unfortunately, I made the (arguably poor) choice of overloading with five credits this quarter, and ended up long on work and short on sleep.
For this reason, I ended up allocating less time to this coding project than I had planned to, and settled for simply getting it working reasonably well.
I'd like to appologize to you for the inefficiencies, to my partner for my delayed start in working on the milestones, and to myself for failing to write code that truly left me satisfied.

Additional comments:

Like me, Kyle was overloaded and overbusy this quarter.
Although neither of us was good about working on the project well ahead of the nearest deadlines, we both put in a good amount of---more or less evenly divided---work in order to get it working JIT.
